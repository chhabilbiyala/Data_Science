 The levels of measurement, also known as scales of measurement, describe the nature of the values assigned to variables. There are four main levels of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio.

1. Nominal Scale Data:
Characteristics: Categories with no inherent order or ranking. Data is labeled or named. No meaningful numerical relationship between categories.
Examples:
Colors (e.g., red, blue, green).
Types of animals (e.g., cat, dog, bird).
Gender (e.g., male, female).
------------------------------------
2. Ordinal Scale Data:
Characteristics: Categories with a meaningful order or ranking. Intervals between categories may not be uniform. Differences in magnitude are not clearly defined.
Examples:
Educational levels (e.g., high school, bachelor's, master's).
Movie ratings (e.g., 1 star, 2 stars, 3 stars).
Customer satisfaction levels (e.g., low, medium, high).
------------------------------------
3. Interval Scale Data:
Characteristics: Categories with a meaningful order. Intervals between values are uniform and measurable. Zero point is arbitrary (no true zero).
Examples:
Temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit.
IQ scores.
Years (measuring the difference between years).
------------------------------------
4. Ratio Scale Data:
Characteristics: Similar to interval scale but with a true zero point. Ratios between values are meaningful and can be calculated.Absolute zero indicates the absence of the variable.
Examples:
Height.
Weight.
Income.
