1) Quantitative Data: Quantitative data involves numerical values and can be either discrete or continuous.
a) Discrete Data: Discrete data consists of distinct, separate values. It usually involves counting and is often represented by whole numbers.
Examples:
Number of students in a classroom.
Number of cars in a parking lot.
Count of books on a shelf.
Number of goals scored in a soccer match.

b) Continuous Data: Continuous data can take any value within a given range. It is not restricted to whole numbers and often involves measurement.
Examples:
Height of individuals.
Weight of objects.
Temperature in degrees Celsius.
Time taken to complete a task.

2) Qualitative Data: Qualitative data involves non-numerical values and can be either nominal or ordinal.
a) Nominal Data: Nominal data represents categories with no inherent order or ranking. It involves labeling or naming attributes.
Examples:
Types of fruits (e.g., apple, banana, orange).
Colors of cars (e.g., red, blue, green).
Types of animals (e.g., cat, dog, bird).

b) Ordinal Data: Ordinal data represents categories with a meaningful order or ranking. The intervals between values are not necessarily uniform.
Examples:
Educational levels (e.g., high school, bachelor's, master's).
Movie ratings (e.g., 1 star, 2 stars, 3 stars).
Customer satisfaction levels (e.g., low, medium, high).
