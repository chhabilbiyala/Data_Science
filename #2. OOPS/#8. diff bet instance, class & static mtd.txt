In Python, class methods, static methods, and instance methods are three types of methods that serve different purposes and are used in different contexts. Here are the key differences between them:

1) Instance Method:
Definition: An instance method is a method that is bound to an instance of the class.
First Parameter: It takes self as its first parameter, which represents the instance of the class.
Access to Instance Attributes: Instance methods have access to instance-specific data and can modify the object's state.
How to Define: They are defined without any decorators.
Usage: Most commonly used type of method. Used when the method needs to interact with or modify instance-specific data.

class MyClass:
    def instance_method(self):
        # Access instance-specific data using self
        print("Instance Method")
-----------------------------------------------------
2) Class Method:
Definition: A class method is a method that is bound to the class and not the instance.
First Parameter: It takes cls as its first parameter, which represents the class itself.
Access to Class Attributes: Class methods have access to class-level data but not to instance-specific data.
How to Define: Decorated with @classmethod.
Usage: Used when the method needs to perform operations related to the class but doesn't require access to instance-specific data.

class MyClass:
    class_variable = "Class Variable"

    @classmethod
    def class_method(cls):
        # Access class-level data using cls
        print(cls.class_variable)
-----------------------------------------------------
3) Static Method:
Definition: A static method is a method that is bound to the class and not the instance.
First Parameter: It doesn't have self or cls as its first parameter. It's a regular function that happens to live in a class body.
Access to Class Attributes: Like class methods, static methods have access to class-level data but not to instance-specific data.
How to Define: Decorated with @staticmethod.
Usage: Used when the method doesn't require access to instance-specific or class-level data. It's often used for utility functions that are related to the class.

class MyClass:
    @staticmethod
    def static_method():
        print("Static Method")
-----------------------------------------------------
In summary:
Instance methods are associated with instances, have access to instance-specific data, and are the most common type of method.
Class methods are associated with the class, have access to class-level data, and are useful for operations related to the class.
Static methods are also associated with the class, don't have access to instance-specific or class-level data, and are often used for utility functions.
