POLYMORPHISM:- Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that refers to the ability of a class to take on multiple forms. In Python, polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type, making it easier to write code that can work with a variety of objects.
Simply, polymorphism in programming refers to the ability of different classes or objects to be treated as instances of a common type. It allows objects of various types to be used interchangeably, providing flexibility and enabling code to work with different objects in a unified way.

Example:- 
class Data_Science:
    def syllabus(self):
        print("This is my syllabus for data science") 

class Web_Dev:
    def syllabus(self):
        print("This is my syllabus for web dev")

class Class_Parser:
    def parse_syllabus(self, class_objs):
        for class_obj in class_objs:
            class_obj().syllabus()

# Creating instances of the classes
data_science = Data_Science()
web_dev = Web_Dev()

# Creating a Class_Parser instance and parsing syllabus
parser = Class_Parser()
parser.parse_syllabus([data_science, web_dev])
------------------
In this code, I have implemented polymorphism using a common method name (syllabus) in two different classes (Data_Science and Web_Dev). The Class_Parser class then demonstrates polymorphism by iterating through a list of instances of these classes and calling the syllabus method on each instance.

In the provided example:
Both the Data_Science and Web_Dev classes have a method called syllabus.
The Class_Parser class can work with instances of these classes without knowing their specific types.
The syllabus method is polymorphic because it behaves differently based on the type of object it is called on.

In essence, polymorphism simplifies code by allowing different classes to share a common interface (like a method name), and the actual behavior is determined at runtime based on the specific class or object being used.
